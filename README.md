# Me vs BlackPerico
-This project have been done by myself alone. I knew HTML & CSS before starting this project of mine and I have made it as a way to start learning Javascript now. Doing my previous project where I was studying HTML & CSS for an year was fun, expressing all the ideas I had about what I could make an element look like and represent something to the client through it. I learnt property by property while demonstrating them on my examples in project to create an interesting yet useful environment.
-Starting this project I knew only the basics of JS (Arrays, Objects, Numbers, Strings, and very few of their Methods). I didn't plan in advance on what my website should look like overall and what it's functionalities would allow it's users to do. I just started having ideas about how to make client-website interactivity smooth, fun and useful. It all started by an idea of user clicking an HTML element that would make another picture appear in it's container (#ad element), which presented quite an challenge at that point. Giving up on my ideas through building this website was not an option, but rather an obsticle I would overcome by reading online about new tools Javascript has to offer that would help me deal with my problems. As I went through building this website the ideas I would get grew more complex but so did my problem-solving skills, from addEventListeners, nodes and styles, up to asynchronous programming and client-server communication and the right ways of dealing with these requests to present the client what they need.
-Now that I have the full picture of what front-end programmer has to deal with, code readability has also became a thing for me as this project's code have been refactured few times whether for only better readability and understanding of what code does or more optimal approach to certain problems I had to deal with. So after an year of studying JS through this project, knowing the most of what Javascript has to offer to an front-end programmer I believe I am ready to meet and deal with real-life work environment and problems in an optimal way that would leave client, employer and most definately me, happy.
## BlackPerico
-This website is meant to be an online shop selling pc electronics and games. It wasn't made to represent my best of CSS-creativity as some elements are left old-fashined but still with attention to certain details to make it look decent enough. This is because website was made so I learn Javascript through it, mainly it's functionality is in focus here. It has good navigation throughout all pages. 
-On home(index) page it has some self-looping-loading elements which are also user-selectable. Certain elements' appearance might change due to differences in screen's width.
-When navigating to certain shop-page an JSON file (in which I keep data about all the products present on website) will be requested from server and page will get filled with certain products (cpu/keyboard/motherboards) present in that JSON file. When all products are created in HTML page then products are looped through checking if product's description fits in description's container. If it doesn't then a new functionality is added: scrolling that product's description by dragging. As products' container element can differ on window resize it is checked each time. After that another HTML element is added: Filters. Filters are added dynamically as well. All newly created products on page are searched for their attributes, they are collected and depending on that result filters are created with their filter-by Title and all the values there might be. Each filter's value shows a number next to it that represents how many of the present products on page has that certain value. Also there is a way to sort products depending on their price, in ascending/descending order. If at least one checkbox is checked from filters list or products are sorted in either way there is a text 'Remove filters' poping up on which's click all filters and sortings are reset. 
-There is a search bar where user can search for any item present in server's JSON as all elements on website are created from data stored in that JSON file. The way this problem is solved is that when user types in something, each word gets add in an array, array is looped through and if in product's name every word is contained the product is displayed below search bar(max 5 responses).*Those responses tho are not clickable, as I didn't want to bother creating an page where all about that product will be displayed.*
All items are purchasable. Local storage API is used for storing info about items user wants to buy and from there data is collected and filled in a specific cart I made for that purpose. In that cart items are stored in order where user can see: index, name of product, price, and a remove button. When remove button is clicked product with that index(id) is removed from cart and localstorage. If user wants that cart to not be displayed as it might be intrusive he can hide it clicking on cart's icon and navigate through rest of website's pages, or keep it open with a single click and navigate through website.
-Website is fully responsive and fits on every screen nicely.
