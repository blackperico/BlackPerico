# BlackPerico
-This project have been done by myself alone. I knew HTML & CSS before starting this project of mine and I have made it as a way to start learning Javascript now. Doing my previous project where I was studying HTML & CSS for an year was fun, expressing all the ideas I had about what I could make an element look like and represent something to the client through it. I learnt property by property while demonstrating them on my examples in project to create an interesting yet useful environment.
-Starting this project I knew only the basics of JS (Arrays, Objects, Numbers, Strings, and very few of their Methods). I didn't plan in advance on what my website should look like overall and what it's functionalities would allow it's users to do. I just started having ideas about how to make client-website interactivity smooth, fun and useful. It all started by an idea of user clicking an HTML element that would make another picture appear in it's container (#ad element), which presented quite an challenge at that point. Giving up on my ideas through building this website was not an option, but rather an obsticle I would overcome by reading online about new tools Javascript has to offer that would help me deal with my problems. As I went through building this website the ideas I would get grew more complex but so did my problem-solving skills, from addEventListeners, nodes and styles, up to asynchronous programming and client-server communication and the right ways of dealing with these requests to present the client what they need.
-Now that I have the full picture of what front-end programmer has to deal with, code readability has also became a thing for me as this project's code have been refactured few times whether for only better readability and understanding of what code does or more optimal approach to certain problems I had to deal with. So after an year of studying JS through this project, knowing the most of what Javascript has to offer to an front-end programmer I believe I am ready to meet and deal with real-life work environment and problems in an optimal way that would leave client, employer and most definately me, happy.
